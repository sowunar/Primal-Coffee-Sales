# Primal-Coffee-Sales
Businesses benefit from Sales Performance Analysis in a variety of ways, including finding areas for development, measuring progress, and boosting revenue. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¹

I analyzed the Primal Coffee sales order data and conducted a sales performance analysis.

Primal Coffee is a large multinational beverage company that produces and sells different varieties of coffee, including Arabica, Liberica, Robusta, and Excelsa, across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

Additionally, Primal Coffee has a reward system for its customers with the highest order and also for its high-value customers in a particular month and year.

In this Sales Performance Dashboard, I provided the following insights:

ðŸ“Œ The current market demand for the company's products and how it varies with the different coffee type.

ðŸ“Œ The current sales performance and how it compares across the different coffee type and region.

ðŸ“Œ The most loyal customers in terms of total sales and orders made.

Steps taken toward the completion of this project include:

âœ” Installing Database backup

âœ” Reading through requirements and preparing user story

âœ” Identifying required tables

âœ” Cleaning tables and creating views in Microsoft Excel

âœ” Connecting the excel file to PowerBI

âœ” Data transformation in Power Query

âœ” Data Modeling

âœ” Data Visualization and

âœ” Publishing to Power BI Service

The database used for this project was taken from the Data by Mo YouTube page. Working on the entire project phase would help you improve your data analysis skills if you are a data enthusiast.
